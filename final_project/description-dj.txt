/// Issues 
///-----------------------------------------------
    -->One of the issues that I had with this game is that when you restar the game it 
    piles all of the items in a straight line. I tried different arrangements in a 
    table, but it still didn't do exactly what I had wanted it to. 
///-----------------------------------------------
/// Future releases
///-----------------------------------------------
    -->In the future I would also like to create more options for different dress up
    puzzles. Next I would like to design a fire fighter dress up game. I would pick a 
    theme to each set up the puzzles and have three or more puzzles that would have one 
    puzzle after the other.
