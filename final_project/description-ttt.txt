/// Issues 
///-----------------------------------------------
    --> I didn't have many issues with tic-tac-toe. Just minor configuration
    errors that were easily fixable.
///-----------------------------------------------
/// Future releases
///-----------------------------------------------
    --> In the future I would like to have multiple levels with a winner 
    after three games.
